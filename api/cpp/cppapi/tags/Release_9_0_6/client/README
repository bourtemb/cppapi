This directory contains the files necessary to implement the easy-to-use 
C++ client api to the TANGO database and devices. It contains the include 
files and source files needed to support the api in the TANGO library. 
Clients need to link with the TANGO library in order to use the api.

There is no Makefile in this directory. The library must be build from the 
../server directory.
